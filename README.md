- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this data science repo grew out of my personal curiosity 5 years ago. With statistical background from Chartered Accountancy days I explored discriptive and inferential statistical methods to better understand mostly web and business data with assistance of statistical tools such as SPSS, minitab, stata. Some initial projects utlized Hypothesis testing, t-test, Chi-square distribution(Understand Click & Engagement Preference in UX), Confidence Interval of mean for Population/Campaigns etc. 
While solving for an multi-channel attribution problem I stumbled across Machine learning, and the incredible powerful insights captured in Adj. R-squared, P-values and Coefficents had me hooked. 
-  Standing at that intersection between the arts and sciences gives me the most joy. And I truly believe to really enjoy Data science and make useful contribution one most approach it like an artist.
